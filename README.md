# Image Classifier - TensorFlow
This was the second project in the Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program from Udacity. In this project, I'll work through a Jupyter notebook first to implement an image classifier with TensorFlow to recognize different species of flowers, then it will be converted into a command line application.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.7.7 -  *Libraries: TensorFlow v2.0.0, NumPy, Matplotlib, json, PIL, and glob*.

## Data
tensorflow_datasets was used to load the [Oxford Flowers 102 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102). This dataset has 3 splits: 'train', 'test', and 'validation'.

## Date created
10/11/2020.
